The google.csv file is loaded using pandas as shown below. Find the index for which the Close price has the lowest value and assign it to the idx_min variable.

Then extract the row for this index from the google DataFrame as a DataFrame. In response, print this DataFrame to the console.

Solution:

import pandas as pd
 
 
google = pd.read_csv('google.csv', index_col=0)
google = google.reset_index()
idx_min = google['Close'].argmin()
print(google.iloc[[idx_min]])
