The df DataFrame is given below. Please note the TotalCharges column. 
The type of this column is set to object. Try to guess why this happened.

Solution:

import pandas as pd
 
 
url = ('https://ml-repository-krakers.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/'
    'kaggle+/churn_modelling/Telco-Customer-Churn.csv')
df = pd.read_csv(url)
 
# Calculation of the median for the TotalCharges column
median = df['TotalCharges'][df['TotalCharges'] != ' '].median()
 
# Fill the missing values with median
df.loc[df['TotalCharges'] == ' ', 'TotalCharges'] = median
 
# Convert TotalCharges column to float type
df['TotalCharges'] = df['TotalCharges'].astype('float')
 
print(df['TotalCharges'].value_counts())
